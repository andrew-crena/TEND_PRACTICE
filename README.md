## TEND_PRACTICE
##### This repo will contain R markdowns that I practice anything learned throughout my time with RStudio. While it is nice to have the code centralized, I want to throw myself into various unexpected problems, and see if I am able to apply the lessons learned to a wide range of settings. This will be a true test of my current capability. I will ask GPT to give me 5 random ideas for assignments, and I will hand pick the data sets from Kaggle and other resources to best fit the type of practice I want.
